    <h1><p align="center">RIGHT TO INFORMATION</p></h1>
    <h2><p align="center" style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">Background</p></h2>
    <h3><p style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">Disclosure of Government Information in India is governed by a law enacted during the British rule over large parts of what is now India, the Official Secrets Act of 1889 which was amended in 1923. This law secures information related to security of the State, sovereignty of the country and friendly relations with foreign states, and contains provisions which prohibit disclosure of non-classified information. Civil Service conduct rules and the Indian Evidence Act impose further restrictions on government officials’ powers to disclose information to the public.</p></h3>
    <h2><p align="center" style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">State-level laws</p></h2>
    <h3><p style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">The RTI Laws were first successfully enacted by the state governments of Tamil Nadu (1997) Goa (1997), Rajasthan (2000), Karnataka (2000), Delhi (2001), Maharashtra (2002), Madhya Pradesh (2003), Assam (2002) and Jammu and Kashmir (2004). The Maharashtra and Delhi State level enactments are considered to have been the most widely used. The Delhi RTI Act is still in force. Jammu &Kashmir has its own Right to Information Act of 2009, the successor to the repealed J&K Right to Information Act, 2004 and its 2008 amendment.</p></h3>
    <h2><p align="center" style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">Freedom of Information Act</p></h2>
    <h3><p style="text-align: justify; color: brown;">Passage of a national level law, however, proved to be a difficult task. Given the experience of state governments in passing practicable legislation, the Central Government appointed a working group under H. D. Shourie and assigned it the task of drafting legislation. The Shourie draft, in an extremely diluted form, was the basis for the Freedom of Information Bill, 2000 which eventually became law under the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. This Act was severely criticized for permitting too many exemptions, not only under the standard grounds of national security and sovereignty, but also for requests that would involve “disproportionate diversion of the resources of a public authority”. There was no upper limit on the charges that could be levied. There were no penalties for not complying with a request for information. The FoI Act, consequently, never came into effective force.</p></h3>
